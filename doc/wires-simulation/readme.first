The wires between the nodes are just simulated with python scripting. Those wires are not objects, and can be deppressed or relaxed, they are also "constrained" to a maximum length.

These simulation is splitted on two parts: game and simulation.

On the game, you can manipulate the wire's relaxation and deppression. The goal of this is: to provide our physicist friends a visual support, so they can generate the net's formulaes.

On the simulation, we put the formulaes generated by the physicist on the wires, so it's going to be a "standalone" graphical simulation of the network in action! you just have to give it a moving asteroid, and the network will do it's work.
